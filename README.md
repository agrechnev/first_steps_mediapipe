First steps with Google Mediapipe: An Informal tutorial
========

By Oleksiy Grechnyev, IT-JIM (https://www.it-jim.com/)  

Development in progress, more detailed readme is coming soon ...  

1. Install bazel and mediapipe, check that 'C++ hello world works'  
2. Copy `first_steps` to `mediapipe/mediapipe/examples`, run just like google examples  

Enjoy!
